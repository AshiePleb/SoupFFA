# SoupFFA

SoupFFA is a plugin designed to regenerate 3.5 hearts in Minecraft when players right-click on soup or stew items. This plugin is especially useful in Free-for-all (FFA) battles or PvP situations where players need to regenerate their health quickly during a fight.

When a player right-clicks on a soup or stew item, the plugin will instantly regenerate 3.5 hearts of the player's health. The soup or stew item is then removed from the player's inventory, preventing them from using it again until they obtain another one.

SoupFFA is easy to install and use and works seamlessly with other plugins on your server. This plugin will enhance the gaming experience of your players by allowing them to focus on the battle instead of worrying about their health.

Overall, SoupFFA is a must-have plugin for any Minecraft server that features PvP gameplay. It's a great addition to any server that wants to make the game more enjoyable and engaging for players.

This plugin is compatible with PocketMine-MP API4 and is regularly updated to ensure optimal performance. Don't wait â€“ take your Minecraft server to the next level and download SoupFFA today!
